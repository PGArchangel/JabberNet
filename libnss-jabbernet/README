libnss_jabbernet:

With the following lines in /etc/nsswitch.conf

passwd:         compat jabbernet
group:          compat jabbernet
shadow:         compat jabbernet

and /lib/libnss_jabbernet.so.2 from this package, glibc will
not only look in /etc/{passwd,shadow,group} but also it will ask a daemon through a socket.


Security considerations:
	Always use after compat in nsswitch.conf,
	otherwise it could overwrite the shadow-password for root.
	(shadow has not uids, so this cannot be ruled out)

	If someone is able to place terminals instead of the
	files, that could cause all programs to get a new
	controling terminal, making DoS attacks possible.
